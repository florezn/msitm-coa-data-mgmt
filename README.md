# City of Austin: Data Management and Strategy
The purpose of this project was to outline the data management strategy the City of Austin should implement to facilitate future city projects and operations and create the most efficient use of resources using open-source datasets. We focus on three transportation datasets, the data management strategy around them as well as ETL processes for analysis. Refer to the Final Presentation for an overview of the project including data strategy and ETL processes, and the Jupyter Notebook for code.

## My Role
